    <h1>About</h1>

    <div class="article-style"> 
        <p>I am a M.Sc. graduate in <a href="https://www.bgu.tum.de/come/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computational Mechanics</a> at the Technical University of Munich with a B.Sc. degree in Civil Engineering at Kuwait University. During my studies and part-time work at the university, I have developed knowledge and interest in software development, Finite Element simulations, Computational Fluid Analysis, and Engineering applications. Currently, I am looking for working full-time on interesting projects.
