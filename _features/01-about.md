    <h1>About</h1>

    <div class="article-style">
      <!-- I am a PhD Student at the [Associate Professorship of Computational Mechanics](https://www.bgu.tum.de/en/cm/home/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), part of a group working on Multi-fidelity Failure Modeling and Optimization for Natural Fiber Structures in Complex Environments, funded by the [International Graduate School of Science and Engineering (IGSSE)](https://www.igsse.gs.tum.de/home/). This project is currently aimed to be implemented in the open-source multiphysics Finite Element framework, [Kratos](https://www.cimne.com/kratos/). -->
<p>I am a M.Sc. graduate in <a href="https://www.bgu.tum.de/come/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computational Mechanics</a> at the Technical University of Munich with a B.Sc. degree in Civil Engineering at Kuwait University. During my studies and part-time work at the university, I have developed knowledge and interest in software development, Finite Element simulations, Computational Fluid Analysis, and Engineering applications. Currently, I am looking for working full-time on interesting projects.</p>
